# Brain control of bimanual movement enabled by recurrent neural networks

![gitbimanual](https://github.com/d-r-deo/bimanualBCI/assets/153785714/379b8a81-07f6-4cd1-a7c5-7ade4a6018c3)

# Overview
This repo is associated with this paper [link] and [dataset](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sn02v6xbb). The code contains a simple Matlab analysis script that demonstrates how to load the datasets and plot cosine tuning curves relating brain activity to directional unimanual/bimanual hand movement. 

To execute the analysis script (tuningAnalysis.m), change the dataPath variable to point at the [data](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.sn02v6xbb) directory and hit 'run'.
